##  Description

This Python program analyzes data from a list of space missions.  
It demonstrates how to use `for` loops, conditional logic, and list indexing to process and extract useful information from parallel lists.

---

##  Features

- Counts the **total number of missions**
- Counts how many missions were **successful**
- Calculates the **success rate** as a percentage
- Lists all **missions launched before the year 2000**

---

##  Sample Data

The data is defined in three parallel lists:

```python
mission_names = ['Apollo 11', 'Challenger', 'Curiosity Rover', 'Viking 1', 'Mars Pathfinder', 'Hubble Telescope', 'Apollo 13']
mission_years = [1969, 1986, 2012, 1975, 1996, 1990, 1970]
mission_success = [True, False, True, True, True, True, False]
